# Algorithms for the rotation distance between binary trees

The C++ code for my B.Sc. thesis and the article "A Rotation Algorithm Based on Induced Equivalent Edges".

## Build

The project uses `Scons` as build system, available on most distributions.

```bash
# install with Python
pip install scons
# or.. install with Homebrew (Mac)
brew install scons
```

Then:

```bash
scons
```
